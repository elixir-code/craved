What is Buddi-CRAVeD ?
----------------------

**Buddi-CRAVeD** ``(ClusteR Analysis and Validation for largE Datasets)`` is a easy-to-use Cluster Analysis, Visualisation and Validation suite. It draws upon the power of standard `Python3 <https://www.python.org/>`_ APIs for data analysis, machine learning and data visualisation.

The suite extends support for an extensive range of :

* Clustering Algorithms
* Internal and External Cluster Validation Indices
* Methods for visualisation of 2D and 3D Data

The suite along with our **modified versions** of the companion libraries (`scikit-learn <http://scikit-learn.org/stable/>`_, `scipy <https://www.scipy.org/>`_) allows us to push the limits on **"maximum size of datasets for cluster analysis on common desktops and laptops"** posed due low main memory availabilty. This feat is achieved by moving the memory-intensive data structures that cloge the main memory onto `HDF5 <https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/>`_ files that can be put on hard-disks.

Who is it intended for ?
------------------------

**Buddi-CRAVeD** is a *"quick-starter"* or *"one-stop"* for machine-learning enthusiasts seeking to explore the areas of **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **Cluster Analysis** and **Cluster Validation** with ease.

It also qualifies as a great companion tool to assist **quality research** on *Cluster Validation* and allied domains.

For those "craving" to **do more** (i.e., process larger datasets) with the **limited main memory** of their desktops and laptops, we help you push the boundaries.
